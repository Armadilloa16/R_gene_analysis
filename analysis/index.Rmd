Welcome to the website summarising the soybean R-gene analysis.


0. EDA of PAV and different classes: [link](eda.html)

1. Plotting of NBS/RLK/RLP plots based on percentage lost: [link](first-analysis.html). These results are mostly not in the paper. Finished.

2. Plotting of NBS/RLK/RLP plots based on total numbers: [link](total_numbers.html). These results are the main part of the paper. Finished.

3. Comparing TEs with variable R-genes: TOCOME

4. Running GWAS with NLR PAV: [link](gwas.html) Under construction.

5. Comparing SNP-based phylogenies with NLR PAV: [link](phylo.html) Under construction.

6. Linking yield with NLR gene counts: [link](yield_link.Rmd). Finished.
