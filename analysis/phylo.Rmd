## Introduction

Here I compare PAV of the most 'different' NLR genes with the SNP-based phylogeny to plot them on top of each other.
```{r setup}
library(ggtree)
```

I made the SNP-based phylogeny using vcftoolkit v0.2.8 on Pawsey's Zeus using 'vk phylo tree nj SNPs_lee.id.biallic_maf_0.05_geno_0.1.vcf > tree.nwk'
